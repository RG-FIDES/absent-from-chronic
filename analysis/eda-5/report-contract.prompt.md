## Mission

Decompose the primary outcome variable (`days_absent_total`) into its 8 constituent LOP
reason categories, directly addressing Sections 4.1 (outcome construction) and 4.2
(distributional statistics) of the statistical instructions. Examines prevalence of each
reason category, relative contribution to the overall absent-day burden, co-occurrence
patterns across reason pairs, conditional intensity among reporters, and the structural
role of the chronic-condition component.

## Data Sources

### Primary

- `data-private/derived/cchs-2-tables/cchs_analytic.parquet` — respondent-level analytical
  dataset (n = 63,843) with all 8 raw LOP component columns (`lopg040`, `lopg070`,
  `lopg082`–`lopg086`, `lopg100`), derived outcomes `days_absent_total` and
  `days_absent_chronic`, and pooled survey weight `wts_m_pooled`

### Supporting

- `data-public/metadata/CACHE-manifest.md` — variable definitions and LOP component mapping
- `data-private/raw/2026-05-15/2026-05-15-transcript-clean.md` — Marc-André review session
  feedback (element-wise exclusion, bootstrap limitation, zero encoding)
- `analysis/data-primer-1/` — canonical data documentation (variable reference, grain proof)

## Research Questions

1. What is the weighted prevalence of each of the 8 LOP reason categories (what proportion
   of workers report ≥1 absent day for each reason)?
2. How much does each LOP component contribute to the weighted mean of `days_absent_total`
   in absolute and relative terms?
3. How many reason categories does a typical respondent report simultaneously, and what is
   the co-occurrence pattern across reason pairs?
4. Among reporters of a given reason, how many days does that reason typically produce
   (conditional intensity)?
5. What structural role does the chronic-condition component play among workers with any
   absence?
6. Are all 8 LOP components complete in the analytical sample, validating the element-wise
   exclusion step that removed 405 respondents with incomplete LOP data?

## Target Graph Families

- **G0** (§4.2): Orientation — zero vs non-zero split in the analytical sample
  - g0: horizontal stacked bar (zero vs ≥1 day)
  - g01: histogram of total missed days among non-zero group, coloured by day range
  - g02: day-range breakdown stacked bar (1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–30, 31+)
- **G1** (§4.1): Prevalence of each LOP reason — % of sample reporting ≥1 day per reason
  - g1: horizontal bar chart, ordered by weighted prevalence
  - g11: faceted by survey cycle (2010–2011 vs 2013–2014)
- **G2** (§4.1): Component contribution — weighted mean days per reason and relative share
  - g2: dot-strip lollipop, absolute contribution + % label
  - g21: stacked bar, relative shares of the component sum
- **G3** (§4.1): Co-occurrence — how many reasons per respondent; pairwise rates
  - g3: bar chart of reason-count distribution (0, 1, 2, …)
  - g31: tile heatmap of pairwise co-occurrence rates
- **G4** (§4.2): Conditional intensity — days produced per reason, among reporters only
  - g4: horizontal bar (weighted mean) + diamond (median), reporters only
  - g41: distribution of `days_absent_total` (non-zeros, log y-scale)
- **G5** (§4.2): Chronic condition's structural role among absent workers
  - g5: three-group classification bar (no chronic / mixed / entirely chronic)
  - g51: bubble chart — `days_absent_chronic` vs `days_absent_total` (both > 0)
- **G6** (§4.1 data quality): LOP component availability — zero vs positive vs missing
  - g6: 100% stacked bar per component confirming zero preserved, 0 missing
  - g61: weighted mean days per component (raw value, all respondents)

## Output Format

HTML (interactive, code-fold, table of contents)

## Upstream EDAs

- eda-1: style reference only
- eda-3 (pending): will cover primary vs sensitivity outcome comparison and §4.1 weighted
  distributional statistics; this EDA complements that planned analysis

## Scope Boundaries

- **Included**: all 8 raw LOP variables, derived outcomes, element-wise exclusion validation
- **Excluded**: inferential tests, predictor variables (Section 5 territory)
- **Excluded**: sensitivity outcome side-by-side comparison (eda-3 territory when created)
- **Excluded**: bootstrap CI computation (not available for pre-2016 CCHS PUMF cycles;
  documented as known limitation per 2026-05-15 review session with Marc-André)

## Marc-André Feedback Addressed

| # | Feedback item | Where addressed |
|---|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Element-wise exclusion: verify that missing on one LOP component does not unnecessarily drop cases | G6: LOP availability chart; text note citing 405-row exclusion from CACHE manifest step 4 |
| 2 | Zero is a valid response — not NA | G6: g6 bar confirms 0 missing + shows zero-day share per component |
| 3 | Bootstrap weights not available for pre-2016 PUMF | Data Context callout citing CACHE-manifest bootstrap note |
| 4 | ~70% zero inflation is expected | G0: g0 stacked bar with zero vs non-zero share |
| 5 | Chronic condition accounts for greatest mean absent days | G5: g5 three-group bar; G2: g2 lollipop |
